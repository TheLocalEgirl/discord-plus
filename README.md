## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discord.com). It's both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is balancing between looks and performance.

All you need to install my theme is [BandagedBetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest). If you already have it installed, you're ready to install my theme! It's as easy as downloading a file and moving it to the right folder.

## User customization
This theme is **very customizable**.
The variables at the top of the file allow you to change things like the background image, the accent color, the roundness of the UI, the fonts, and even the backdrop behind elements. Just open the file up in a text editor, and you're on your way.
